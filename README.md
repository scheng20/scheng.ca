# [Scheng.ca](https://scheng.ca/)
My personal portfolio website displaying my career experiences, projects, and skills. Coded using Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, Bootstrap and Styled Components. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## :star: Introduction 
After creating my first personal website with WordPress, I was never truly satisfied with how it looked. I felt frustrated by the limitations I had to work with from using a third-party platform. As a result, I made it a goal to teach myself JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to code my own website from scratch. Along the way, I also picked up React and Bootstrap, allowing me to finally build the website you see today.
