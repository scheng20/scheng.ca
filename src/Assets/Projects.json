        "modal_summary": "While working as a marketing director for UBC BizTech, I noticed that the creation of our event sharing schedules is a very tedious and repetitive task. As a result, I decided to build a Java program that generates these schedules automatically, directly coding our marketing strategy and scheduling algorithm into the program. I single handily wrote this 1500+ line program using Java for the algorithms and WindowBuilder for the GUI.",

        "modal_summary": "Working in a team of 5, I was responsible for implementing the auto-scroll feature, which enabled a webpage to scroll down when the user reads the last words on screen out loud. I implemented this feature using a text-scraping function written in JavaScript. Additionally, I also implemented a toggle button, allowing the user to turn voice recognition on/off inside the extension popup. Other commands of our extension include: \"go down/up\", \"open/close tab\", \"go back/forward\", and \"reload/refresh\".",
