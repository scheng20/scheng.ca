# [Scheng.ca](https://scheng.ca/)
My personal portfolio website displaying my career experiences, projects, and skills. Coded using Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, Bootstrap and Styled Components. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## :star: Introduction 
After creating the first version of my website using WordPress, I was never truly satisfied with how it looked, and the limitations I had to deal with by using a third-party platform. As a result, I made it a goal to teach myself JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to code my own website from scratch. Along the way, I found out about React and itâ€™s abilities to greatly enhance the web development experience. Eventually, I also picked up React bootstrap, and was finally able to create the website you see today using my own code.
